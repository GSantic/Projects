This registry contains data on Age-Adjusted Incidence Rates and Confidence Intervals for Cancer types by Age in the United States. Rates are per 100,000 persons and are age-adjusted to the 2000 U.S. standard population (19 age groups - Census P25-1130). Since 1994, CDCâ€™s National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) has funded state cancer registries to collect population-based cancer incidence data under Public Law 102-515, the Cancer Registries Amendment Act.
